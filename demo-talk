Hi, this is GAUGER, audience analytics with Cortana.

So... 2016's election year and the pundits have their views on the candidates and their communication styles. 

According to them, Donald's favorite word's "I" and the word most associated with Hilary's "emails". 

But that's just some pundits. What about you guys? Let's imagine I'm a 2016 candidate.

We're gonna GAUGE your reaction to my pitch with this Ricoh Theta and Cortana's emotion recogntion and speech to text APIs.

Deliver mash-up of Donald's worst and Obama's best speeches.

{In background, Theta collects audience facial expressions as speech to text happens and it all feeds to dashboard.}

This use case is for politicians and their campaign managers. $6 billion will be spent in marketing and ads for 2016 elections. And Gauger will enable campaign managers to benchmark their Comms effectiveness and ad spend 
can help them calculate their Comms effectiveness and ad spend efficiencies. 

It could also be used for CEOs to gauge if investors are happy or contemptuous about their quarterly results and which words their
audience think are negative and positive.
